# D3: Bit quest

## Gameplay Goal

The gameplay takes place on a map of the campus, with minimalistic cells about the size of a small house projected on top of the map. The cells are all labelled with numbers < 7. The player is able to add one cell to their inventory at a time and combine them with cells of the same value, with the goal of getting as large a cell as possible. The play can move around the map with the arrow keys.

## Technologies

1. TypeScript for most game code, little to no explicit HTML, and all CSS collected in common `style.css` file
2. Deno and Vite for building
3. GitHub Actions + GitHub Pages for deployment automation
